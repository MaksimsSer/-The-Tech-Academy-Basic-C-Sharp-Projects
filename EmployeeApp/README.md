EmployeeApp

This C# console application demonstrates the usage of overloaded operators (== and !=) in the context of the Employee class. It compares Employee objects based on their ID property.

Description

The program consists of two files:

Program.cs: This file contains the Main method, which is the entry point of the program. It creates instances of the Employee class and tests the overloaded operators == and !=.
Employee.cs: This file defines the Employee class. It contains the properties Id, FirstName, and LastName, along with a constructor to initialize an Employee object. 
It also overloads the == and != operators to compare Employee objects based on their ID property.

Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.
Build and run the program.
View the comparison results printed to the console.

Note

This program serves as a demonstration of overloading operators in C# and how they can be used to define custom equality comparisons between objects. 
You can modify the program to add additional functionality or customize it according to your requirements.
