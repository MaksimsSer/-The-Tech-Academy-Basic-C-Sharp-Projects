Main Method Assignment

This C# program showcases the usage of method overloading in the context of mathematical operations.

Description

The program consists of two files:

Program.cs:
This file contains the Main method, serving as the entry point of the program.
It instantiates an object of the MathMethods2 class and calls its methods with different types of parameters.
The results of the method calls are printed to the console.
MathMethods2.cs:
This file defines the MathMethods2 class, which contains overloaded methods for performing mathematical operations.
It includes three overloaded versions of the MathOp method, each accepting a different type of parameter (int, decimal, string).
Each MathOp method performs a different mathematical operation based on the parameter type.

Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
Build and run the program.
