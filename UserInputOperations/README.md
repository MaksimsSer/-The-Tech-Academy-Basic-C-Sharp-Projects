User Input Operations

This C# program demonstrates basic mathematical operations performed on user input.

Description

The program consists of one file:

Program.cs:
This file contains the Main method, serving as the entry point of the program.
It prompts the user to input a number and converts the input to a double.
It then performs the following operations on the input:
Multiplies the input by 50 and prints the result.
Adds 25 to the input and prints the result.
Divides the input by 12.5 and prints the result.
Checks if the input is greater than 50 and prints true or false accordingly.
Divides the input by 7 and prints the remainder.
After performing the operations, it keeps the console window open until a key is pressed.

Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
Build and run the program.
Enter a number when prompted by the program.

Program Execution

The program prompts the user to input a number.
It converts the input to a double and performs multiple mathematical operations on it.
It prints the results of each operation to the console.
After performing all operations, it keeps the console window open until a key is pressed.
