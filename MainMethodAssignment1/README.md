Main Method Assignment

This C# program demonstrates the usage of optional parameters in a method within the context of performing mathematical operations.

Description

The program consists of two files:

Program.cs:
This file contains the Main method, serving as the entry point of the program.
It prompts the user to enter one or two integers as parameters for a mathematical operation.
Depending on the user input, it calls the MathOperation method of the MathOperation1 class with either one or two parameters.
The results of the mathematical operation are printed to the console.
MathOperation1.cs:
This file defines the MathOperation1 class, which contains the MathOperation method.
The MathOperation method takes two integers as parameters, with one of them being optional (having a default value of 1).
It performs multiplication on the provided integers and returns the result.

Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
