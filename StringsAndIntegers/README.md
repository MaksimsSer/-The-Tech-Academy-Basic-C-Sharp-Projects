Strings and Integers

This C# program demonstrates error handling using try/catch blocks and working with lists of integers.

Description

The program consists of one file:

Program.cs:
This file contains the Main method, serving as the entry point of the program.
It creates a list of integers named intList containing a set of numbers.
It utilizes a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user to enter a number to divide the numbers in the list by.
Inside the loop, a try/catch block is used to handle potential errors, such as dividing by zero or entering non-numeric input.
If the user enters 0, the program informs them to enter a number other than 0.
If the user enters a valid number, each number in the list is divided by the input, and the result is displayed to the console.
The loop continues until a valid number is entered.
Once the loop exits, a message is displayed to inform the user that the program has exited the try/catch block.
The console window remains open until a key is pressed.
