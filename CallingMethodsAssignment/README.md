Calling Methods Assignment

This C# program simulates a combat encounter with an enemy brigand named Groznyi, utilizing various methods for defense, healing, and attack.

Description

The program consists of two files:

Program.cs: This file contains the Main method, which is the entry point of the program. It simulates a combat encounter with Groznyi by calling methods from the MathMethods class to calculate damage, healing, and counter-attack damage based on user input for defense, magic, and strength stats.
MathMethods.cs: This file defines the MathMethods class, which contains three static methods:
Heal(int magic): Calculates the amount of hitpoints healed based on the magic stat provided.
Defense(int defense): Calculates the damage taken from an enemy attack based on the defense stat provided.
Attack(int strength): Calculates the damage dealt to the enemy based on the strength stat provided.

Note

This program serves as a basic demonstration of calling methods in C# to simulate combat scenarios. You can use it as a reference or starting point for further exploration and learning about method invocation and parameter passing in C#.
