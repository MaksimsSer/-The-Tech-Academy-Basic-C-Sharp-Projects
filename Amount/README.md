Struct Example: Number

This C# program demonstrates the use of a struct called Number to store and manipulate a decimal value.

Description

The program consists of two files:

Program.cs: This file contains the Main method, which is the entry point of the program. It creates an object of type Number, assigns a value to its Amount property, and prints the value to the console.
Number.cs: This file defines the Number struct, which has a single property Amount of type decimal.
Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
Build and run the program.

Note

Structs are similar to classes but are value types rather than reference types. They are typically used for small, lightweight objects that are frequently copied or passed by value.
