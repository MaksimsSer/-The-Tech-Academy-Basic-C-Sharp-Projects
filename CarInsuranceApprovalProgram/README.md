Car Insurance Approval Program

This C# console application determines whether a user qualifies for car insurance based on their age, DUI history, and number of speeding tickets.

Description

The program consists of a single file:

Program.cs: This file contains the Main method, which is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to input their age, DUI history, and number of speeding tickets. Based on these inputs, the program checks whether the user qualifies for car insurance according to specific rules:
Age must be greater than 15.
The user must not have a DUI history.
The number of speeding tickets must be less than or equal to 3.
After evaluating these criteria, the program prints whether the user qualifies for car insurance.

Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.
Build and run the program.
Follow the on-screen prompts to input your age, DUI history, and number of speeding tickets.
The program will then determine whether you qualify for car insurance and display the result.

Note

This program serves as a basic demonstration of conditional logic in C# for determining eligibility criteria. You can modify the criteria or add additional features to suit your requirements.
